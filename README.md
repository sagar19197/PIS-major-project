Art Concept Description: Explain in words and through an annotated sketch your concept. Include what medium you are going to use. What demographics is the installation for?



Interactive art, according to Wikipedia “is a form of art that involves the spectator in a way that allows the art to achieve its purpose”. Therefore our project mainly focuses on the involvement of spectator and becomes a part of the art. In the project we are using pose detection techniques to receive human gestures and behaviour and use them to cause the artwork to change. In our art installation the spectator would be standing in front of the camera and make some gestures such as moving hands or walking. These behaviours are detected using pose detection techniques. In the installation we are projecting animated art on a screen using a projector. The animated artwork would change corresponding to behaviour/gestures of the human.
We know that the 21st century is all about connection and interactivity of humans with machines. Artworks also, need not be ‘static’ and should be ‘interactive’. This is achieved by the involvement of computers with art. This is what we think interactive art is and our project is based on.
Demographics: Art is something which doesn’t ask for age, caste, or any other kind of discrimination. Therefore our art installation is not focused on some particular kind of people. Anyone can be a part of the installation.






Fundamental basis for our installation:

Uniqueness: Justify what is unique about your concept and why will it be interesting to try.

This project is very interactive and thus is unique and involving. The unique thing about the project is how it is implemented. It will give the spectators immersive feeling as it is very involving and interactive. The artwork is not like the traditional one or static but this project involves the interaction of the spectator and allow them to become part of the artwork.





Technical Implementation details: Share what technical requirements will you have for implementation of this concept.


     



We will be using openpose/tf- pose estimation or processing IDE  to take input of gestures made by the spectator through a webcam or camera. We will be making animated art using Unity/Processing player. Then by integrating openpose/ tensorpose with unity/processing IDE we will make our art installation interactive. So requirements for the project includes:
Openpose/tensorpose
Camera/webcam
Projector
OpenCV
Python3
Unity
Processing
